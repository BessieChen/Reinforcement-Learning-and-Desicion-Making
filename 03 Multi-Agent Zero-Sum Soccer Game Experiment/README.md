### Instruction:

1. I wrote this .py file on Python 2.7 version

2. I imported "numpy", "matplotlib.pyplot", "time", "cvxopt", "copy" packages

3. You may not have package "cvxopt", which can be used to solve the linear program. You can install it by following the installation instruction in https://cvxopt.org/install/index.html.
I downloaded the version 1.1.18, for more info, click: https://cvxopt.org/index.html

4. There are four algorithms in project 3, and each of them generates a graph depicting the q-value difference curve.
In project03_bchen372.py, four functions are created and each of them corresponds to one algorithm, please choose the algorithm you want to plot by uncommenting the corresponding function and then running it directly.
