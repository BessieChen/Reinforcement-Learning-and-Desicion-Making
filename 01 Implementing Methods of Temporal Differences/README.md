1. I wrote this .py file on Python 2.7 version

2. I imported "numpy", "matplotlib.pyplot", "time", "tqdm"

3. You may not have package "tqdm", which can be used to visualize the progress of running procedure.
You can install it through:
-pip install tqdm
I downloaded the version 4.31.1, for more info, click:
https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/#ipython-jupyter-integration

4. I combined all 3 experiments in this .py file, if you want to print the figure 3 in Sutton's paper, go to the main function and un-comment the function figure_3(), for figure 4 and 5, un-comment the corresponding function and then run it directly. I used to run only one function at one time.
